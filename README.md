# Unified Segementation with Lesion, aka. USwLesion
"Unified Segementation" for brain images showing focal brain lesions.

For the moment, the whole project lives in a separate private repository, called [USwLesion](https://github.com/CyclotronResearchCentre/USwLesion). This will be made public as soons as we have published our approach somewhere. We are currrently submitting an abstract for [next OHBM conference](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3734) and planning a real paper at some point...

You can still request an access by contacting [me](http://www.giga.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_39293/en/phillips-christophe-ir-phd) directly at the following email address: `c_dot_phillips_at_ulg_dot_ac_dot_be`. Then I'll add you to the contributors list. :-)
